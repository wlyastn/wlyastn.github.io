    <h2>Problem statement: [title]</h2>
    <p>
     Trains crossing the tracks at several intersections in Columbia, SC, are causing delays for students trying to get to class on time. Students are having to leave for class earlier, miss classes, or cut into their study time or sleep due to the unpredictable crossing times.

      <h2>Problem statement: Trains in Columbia, SC</h2>
      <p>
        Trains crossing the tracks at several intersections in Columbia, SC, are causing delays for students trying to get to class on time. Students are having to leave for class earlier, miss classes, or cut into their study time or sleep due to the unpredictable crossing times.

        <h2>Team Storyboards: Troubles with Trains in Columbia, SC</h2>
      </a>
      <p>
        In my storyboard, a potential user of our app decided to go over a train track, to catch a green light, in order to get to class on time. Instead, they got hit by a train. This all could have been prevented if the user had used our app to take a different route.
